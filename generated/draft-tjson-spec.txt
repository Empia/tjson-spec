   Tagged JavaScript Object Notation (TJSON) Data Interchange Format
                            draft-tjson-spec

Abstract

   Tagged JavaScript Object Notation (TJSON) is a data interchange
   format which is backwards compatible with the JavaScript Object
   Notation (JSON)[ @!RFC7159] format.  It adds first-class type
   annotations ("tags") for supporting a richer set of types within JSON
   documents.

1.  Introduction

   Tagged JavaScript Object Notation (TJSON) is a set of backwards-
   compatible extensions to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC7159]
   which enrich the set of types the format is able to express.

   TJSON can represent six primitive types (strings, binary data,
   integers, floating points, datetimes, and null) and two structured
   types (objects and arrays).

   To extend JSON with additional types in a backwards-compatible
   manner, TJSON adds a special mandatory "tag" to each JSON string
   which identifies the data type and, optionally, encoding format.  A
   tag consists of one or more alphanumeric characters, followed by the
   colon ":" character.  All strings in TJSON MUST have a valid tag
   prefix.

   TJSON is intended to simplify transcoding documents from other
   interchange formats which disambiguate strings from binary data, and
   also improve the ability to both canonicalize and authenticate JSON
   documents.
